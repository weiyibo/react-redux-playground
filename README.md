# react-starter-kit

I implement 3 tabs(matched jobs, accepted jobs & rejected jobs). 
Clicking accept and reject buttons, the job will go the relative tabs. 
Jobs list in panel, it can collapse and expend (default is expended) 
It contains the following libs:

* React
* React Redux
* React Router,
* React Redux Router, 
* Bootstrap
* Bootswatch (Cosmo be default, because I like it)
* Less
* Busy Indicator
* Webpack
* ExtractPlugin (Extract css into separate file)
* react-bootstrap
* merge
* moment-tz

# Run

```
npm install
npm start
```

# Deplay

```

```

The files will be in **Build** folder
